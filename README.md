# Data Hazards Project - Case Study
- This is a poster I created as a summary of the work I do for my PhD to think about what Data Hazards (DH) apply.

- It was presented during AI UK 2022.

- Please find poster here: [`20230314_DH_casestudy.pdf`](20230314_DH_casestudy.pdf).
- The idea behind it would be so that people can have a look at what the project is about and then decide which [Data Hazard labels](https://datahazards.com/contents/data-hazards.html) would apply to it.

- So below the poster, there'd be a set up list with the labels and people would put a sticker on the label they thought would apply. I did not think to take a photo of the poster by itself so here is a photo of how it looked with a proud Susana next to it.

## Insights from the day
During the poster presentation, people talked about the project, had a look at the poster, and decided by adding stickers to a list of hazards, to say which ones applied to it.

At the end of the day, I recorded final numbers and the results can be seen in the barchart below.

An in depth discussion of these results is provided in my third year report, available here: [https://susana465.quarto.pub/3rd-year-report/30-data_hazards.html](https://susana465.quarto.pub/3rd-year-report/30-data_hazards.html)
